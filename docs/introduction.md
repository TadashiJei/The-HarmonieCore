# 📖 Introduction to HarmonieCORE

## Vision Statement

In an evolving digital landscape where artists often struggle with opaque revenue models and limited direct fan engagement, HarmonieCORE emerges as a beacon of empowerment. It provides a direct conduit between artists and their supporters, leveraging the power of Web3 to create a more equitable and interactive music ecosystem.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Traditional Music Industry Challenges

The traditional music industry presents significant hurdles for independent artists:

#### 🔴 Limited Monetization
- Artists receive a fraction of revenue from traditional streaming platforms
- Making it difficult to sustain their careers
- Revenue sharing models favor platforms over creators

#### 🔴 Lack of Transparency
- Opaque payment structures obscure the true value of an artist's work
- Intermediaries take substantial cuts without clear justification
- Artists have limited visibility into their earnings breakdown

#### 🔴 Disconnected Fan Engagement
- Social media exists, but direct, real-time, and financially impactful fan interaction is fragmented
- Non-existent financial interaction during performances
- Fans have no direct way to support artists during live sessions

#### 🔴 Intellectual Property Concerns
- Ensuring proper attribution and protection for original music is complex
- Rights management systems are outdated and inefficient
- Difficult to prove ownership and track usage

#### 🔴 Accessibility Barriers
- High barriers to entry for new artists to gain visibility and support
- Platform algorithms favor established artists
- Geographic and economic barriers limit artist reach
